We'll start at i = 10 and loop while i > 0. We'll decrement i by 2 each loop with i -= 2.

const ourArray = [];

for (let i = 10; i > 0; i -= 2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}

Push the odd numbers from 9 through 1 to myArray using a for loop.

const myArray = [];

for (var i = 9; i > 0; i-=2) {
  myArray.push(i);
}

console.log(myArray) myArray should equal [9, 7, 5, 3, 1].
