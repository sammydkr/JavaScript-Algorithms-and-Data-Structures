const ourArray = [];
let i = 0;

do {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);

Here is a regular while loop that will run the code in the loop as long as i < 5:

const ourArray = []; 
let i = 5;

while (i < 5) {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
}

onst myArray = [];
let i = 10;

do {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i <= 10);



while (i < 5) {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
Change the while loop in the code to a do...while loop so the loop will push only the number 10 to myArray, and i will be equal to 11 when your code has finished running.
